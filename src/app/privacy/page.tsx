      <p>
        Welcome to our Privacy Policy, where we navigate the treacherous waters
        of legal jargon to tell you what we&apos;re doing with your data.
        Here&apos;s the lowdown, in plain-ish English:
      </p>
      <ol className="space-y-3">
        <li>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">
            Your Info is Gold... but Not to Us
          </h2>
          <p>
            We collect some of your info (name, email, favorite ice cream
            flavor) because, well, that&apos;s what websites do. But fear not,
            we guard it like a dragon hoards gold. Minus the fire-breathing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">
            Sharing is Caring... but Not with Everyone
          </h2>
          <p>
            We might share your info with partners or service providers. Rest
            assured, we only let them peek through the window; they can&apos;t
            crash on the couch.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">Cookies: Not the Tasty Kind</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, we use cookies. No, they won&apos;t satisfy your sweet tooth.
            They just help us track what you&apos;re up to on our site.
            It&apos;s like having a friendly but slightly nosy neighbor.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">
            Your Security is Our Top Priority... Most of the Time
          </h2>
          <p>
            We&apos;ve set up Fort Knox-level security measures. Well, almost.
            Picture more like a trusty padlock than a laser grid.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">Third-Party Shenanigans</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes, our site may have links to other places. We&apos;re not
            responsible for their shenanigans. Click wisely, young padawan.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">Changes? Oh, Yes, We Change</h2>
          <p>
            We might tweak this policy occasionally. But don&apos;t worry,
            we&apos;ll send a carrier pigeon to let you know (or maybe just an
            email).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2 className="font-bold text-lg">You&apos;re in Control... Kinda</h2>
          <p>
            You can ask us to delete your info. Just don&apos;t expect us to
            erase it like it&apos;s a dusty whiteboard; there might be some
            digital remnants.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        By using our site, you agree to these terms. If you don&apos;t, well,
        there&apos;s always the offline world, where the privacy policy is
        simply called &quot;common sense.&quot;
